To generate documentation for the python files
the following has to be done:

First:
Install doxypy:

      apt-get install doxypy

Second (Optional):
If graphs over the hierarchy in the project is
requested, the following command need to be
included. If this is not installed doxygen will
give errors while trying to parse the graph part
of the documentation. These errors can be ignored
due to they are not interfering with the rest of
the documentation:

      apt-get install graphviz

Third:
You have to stand in the same folder as
the Doxyfile file which is located in the
same folder were the src folder is located.
Then run the following command:

      doxygen

Forth:
To see the generated documentation an index.html
file is now generated. This file can be located
in the doc/html folder. Open this index.html file
in your favorite browser.


Good to know:
If documentation was generated and changes to the
code was done and you want to generate new documentation,
to ensure that the changes done to
the code is included in the new documentation, you
should remove the doc folder before running the doxygen
command again.
